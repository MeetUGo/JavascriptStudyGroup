We review the https://socket.io/get-started/chat/ example, and Zhao Lei share his interesting project! 

Review:

1.package.json <--dependencies--> npm

2."index.js" <--> server
tools: http(already install node.js+npm), express (install via npm), socket.io (install via npm)

"http + express" to create server,get request(/) from client, and resond index.html file, listen on port 

"socket.io" by passing the http object. socket.on recive information from client, socket.emit sent information to client

3."index.html" <--> client
tool: jquery.js(js library),/socket.io/socket.io.js--generate by socket.io??
use jquery.js
$('label') to search html <label>
$('#Id') to search label with id "Id"
$('.Class') to search label with class "Class"

socket.emit to sent information to server
socket.on to recive information from server
